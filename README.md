# Arabic paraphrasing benchmark
This dataset consists of 1010 Arabic sentence pairs: 
Experts collected the first part in the sentence pairs from different Arabic books and some of these sentences are generated using words from AWSS dataset (Almarsoomi et al. 2013); the second part is transformed from the first part using six transformation rules for Arabic language. The six transformation rules are : permutation, replacement, deletion, addition, expansion and reduction.
